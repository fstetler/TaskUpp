# INTERVIEW PROGRAMMING TASK

This is a sample application, with a couple of tasks that should be completed before technical interview.

## Keep in mind
* Code should be clear
* Features should be tested
* Naming should be consistent and relevant
* Make note on anything you find could be improved

## Tasks
* Add a field status to the Task entity, options should be Open or Completed
* If you query a task that does not exist the application returns a 500, make it better
* Add an action to create a new task
