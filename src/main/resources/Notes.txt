// notes to assignment ----
// Add autowired in order to instantiate repository
// Added RequestMapping("/tasks") so all mapping uses it instead of just GetMapping, saves space for PostMapping
// Changed GetMappingPath with id so not to call /tasks/ twice
// Changed name from getTasks to getTaskById for easier readability/logical
// Removed unneeded throwing of exception warning
// Changed NotFoundException to ResponseStatusException to better represent what is actually happening
// Added server error message in application.properties in order for ResponseStatusException to show error message
